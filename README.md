# STMSNZ-Web
A website for STMSNZ, with docker compose to run a webserver for testing

## Using this project
This project is really just a remote backup of this website code, incase it needs to be viewed, edited, or recovered outside of my local machine. If you want to see this website but do not have a PHP server running, the provided `docker-compose.yml` will boot a webserver and host the website for you. Simply run `docker-compose up` and point your web browser to [`localhost:8080`](localhost:8080)
